# Assuming you have not yet modified this file, each configuration option below
# is set to its default value. Note that some are commented out while others
# are not: uncommented lines are intended to protect your configuration from
# breaking changes in upgrades (i.e., in the event that future versions of
# Devise change the default values for those options).
#
# Use this hook to configure devise mailer, warden hooks and so forth.
# Many of these configuration options can be set straight in your model.
Devise.setup do |config|
  # ==> Mailer Configuration
  # Configure the e-mail address which will be shown in Devise::Mailer,
  # note that it will be overwritten if you use your own mailer class
  # with default "from" parameter.
  config.mailer_sender = 'no-reply@monapp.com'

  # Configure the class responsible to send e-mails.
  config.mailer = 'Devise::Mailer'

  # ==> ORM configuration
  # Load and configure the ORM. Supports :active_record (default) and
  # :mongoid (bson_ext recommended) by default. Other ORMs may be
  # available as additional gems.
  require 'devise/orm/active_record'

  # ==> Configuration for :database_authenticatable
  # For bcrypt, this is the cost for hashing the password and defaults to 12. If
  # using other algorithms, it sets how many times you want the password to be hashed.
  config.stretches = Rails.env.test? ? 1 : 12

  # ==> Configuration for :recoverable
  # Time interval you can reset your password with a reset password key.
  config.reset_password_within = 6.hours

  # ==> Navigation configuration
  # Lists the formats that should be treated as navigational. Formats like
  # :html should redirect to the sign in page when the user does not have
  # access, but formats like :xml or :json, should return 401.
  config.navigational_formats = ['*/*', :html, :turbo_stream]

  # ==> Hotwire/Turbo configuration
  # When using Devise with Hotwire/Turbo, the http status for error responses
  # and some redirects must match the following. The default in Devise for existing
  # apps is `200 OK` and `302 Found` respectively, but new apps are generated with
  # these new defaults that match Hotwire/Turbo behavior.
  config.responder.error_status = :unprocessable_entity
  config.responder.redirect_status = :see_other
